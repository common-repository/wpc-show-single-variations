WPC Show Single Variations helps you show all variations as single products on the archive pages.

== Description ==

**WPC Show Single Variations** is a nice plugin for presenting variations of variable products as single items on catalog pages. Variations will appear on the catalogs (shop, category page, tag & search results) as normal simple items, but still, stay within the variable parent products. Users can adjust the display at ease by enabling/disabling the functionality on the system basis or reversing it on the variation basis from the Variations tab.

This type of display creates an abundant & straightforward appearance of items in your store and assists customers in searching for the right choice with fewer clicks. It is indeed a great & easy-to-use tool to organize your online store to attain better convenience & performance.
